# C-_NonGeneric_Collection
The Non-Generic Collection Classes such as ArrayList, Hashtable, SortedList, Stack, and Queue are worked on the object data type.


# Type Safety

Non-generic collections are not type-safe because they store elements as object types. As a result, explicit casting is often required when retrieving elements.
Type-related errors may only be discovered at runtime.

# Usability

Non-generic collections are less user-friendly because they involve casting and boxing/unboxing operations when working with elements.
Casting can make the code less readable and more error-prone.

# Performance

Non-generic collections may have performance overhead due to the need for boxing (converting value types to reference types) and unboxing (converting reference types back to value types).
This can result in performance degradation, especially when working with value types.
